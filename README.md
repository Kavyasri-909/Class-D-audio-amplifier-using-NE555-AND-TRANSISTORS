# Class-D-audio-amplifier-using-NE555-AND-TRANSISTORS
The project that i have built to make the class-D ammplifier more efficient and high noise tolerable,With the combination of  switching technique using the MOS transistors,LC filter and the error block ,along with the high efficient output block .
